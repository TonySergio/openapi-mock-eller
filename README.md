# OpenAPI v3 Mock Server

A very alpha server for generating mock data from an OpenAPI v3 spec.

The codebase is very small, contributions are very welcome. :smile:

## Usage

No npm module yet, sorry. You can clone this repo though.

```
node server.js <spec.yaml>
```

Your server is now running on `localhost:8001`.
